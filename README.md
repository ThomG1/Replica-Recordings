# Replica-Recordings

The Replica Recordings is a record label celebrating new and underground alternative music from South Wales. This website is a place that both looks to platform the artists that have released music on the label, and serve as an invitation for new artists to connect and create with the label also. 

![Mock Up](documentation/screenshots/mockups1.jpg)


The website consists of three pages: the Home page, the Artists page, and the Demo's page

## User Experience (UX)

- __Design Choices__

The overall feel of the sites design is dark, ambigious and atmospheric as this matches the style and aethetic of the music released on the label. 

- __Font__
The font used throughout the site is Chakra Petch to give the site an industrial feel, achieved by the lack of curves in the letters. This also works in contrast to the heavily curved, abstract shapes used in the background.

- __Icons__
The icons used from font awesome were chosen for their simplicity to ensure all users can identify them.

- __Colours__

The colours used are intentionally minimal. The primary colours used in the background are black and grey. To contrast used, the font throughout is white. 
The other colours featured in the website are from the release artworks, or artist profiles. There is no set colour scheme for these as they are dependant on the artist, however this in itself is a stylistic choice that highlights the individuality and uniqueness of the artists against the minimal colour scheme of the main website.

- __First Time Users__

1.As a first time user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and the record labels role as a promoter of existing artists, and a platform for emerging artists.

2.As a first time user, I want to be able to get good visual representation of the musical content released without having heard the music, from the aesthetic of the website, artist profiles and release artworks.

3.As a first time user, I want clear and distinguishable sections that are easy to find and move between. 

4.As a first time user, I want to be able to leave the website to find out more via social media or access the music directly.

- __Returning Users__

1. As a returning user, I want to easily find the links I didn't use the first time, for instance if I checked out the social media, I now want to find the music.

2. As a returning user, I want to be easily able to find what updated have occurred since my last visit. 

3. As a returning user, I want to know how to submit music, and see how I'll be represented.

- __The Logo__
 
  - Whilst part of the Navbar, it's important to highlight the logo on the left hand side. The image contains the signature Replica Recordings image, serving as both the quickest possible way for a user to identify the brand, and an eye-catching anchor at the top of the page that will return the user to the home page from other parts of the site.

- CSS
  
  Some errors were found when passing through the official CSS validator, although on investigation, it appears the errors displayed are a result of bootstrap, rather than errors in the CSS code itself

  When the code itself is copied and pasted into the validator, this displays no errors:
